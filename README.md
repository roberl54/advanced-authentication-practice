# Setup
* Fork, clone, yarn install, yarn start

# Database
* Make sure you are running mongoDB or using Mlab
* Make sure you have a database called “authentication-practice”

# Client

### Sign In
* Create a component called SignIn
* Use SignUp as an example
* Make sure the button says Sign In
* It doesn’t need the confirm text box
* It needs a prop called onSignIn that is a function
* In handleSubmit, call onSignIn
* in App.js, assign the handleSignIn function to the onSignIn prop of SignUpSignIn component
* In SignUpSignIn.js assign the onSignIn prop of SignIn , (do the same things as onSignUp)
* Use the SignIn component in the SignUpSignIn component

### Implement handleSignIn in App.js
* Need to do a fetch post to /signin
* Code will probably almost the same as handleSignUp
* In the first fetch `then` there is a parameter for the `response`
* this object has a property called status
* If the value of status is 401 it means the login was invalid, setState for an error message
* Else just return JSON as normal

### Secured Components
* Create 3 class components it doesn’t matter what they are
* componentDidMount should use fetch to make a GET request to a secured path that you create
* In App.js renderApp, add routes for these components

### App
* Fix App.js handleSignUp
    * It is common practice to make sure you know what password you are typing in by having the user type it in twice and ensure they typed the same thing each time
    * It is not checking whether password and confirm password are the same. Implement this logic and show an error message.
    * The promise callback function is not handling the error of if you sign up with a username that already exists
    * Check whether an error message was returned from the server and show it.

### TopNavbar.js
* Add 3 more Links for the secured components routes
* The component is not using the property showNavItems
    * Use this property to determine whether to show the Nav Items, only show the secured routes if showNavItems === true
    * The sign out should always be shown

# Server
* Create 3 secure routes on the server
* It doesn’t matter what they return
* If the request is not authenticated then the route should not be executed at it should return unauthorized.
* Make a fetch get request to these routes in the secure components

# Extra Credit
* Implement the popular feature of telling the user if a username is available as soon as they type it in

# Points
* Sign In works - 25pts
* Confirm password works - 25pts
* Existing username error works - 25pts
* Secure components - 25pts
* Secure routes - 25pts
